# Technologies
For front-end, we chose to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript since we all have some understanding of it and we wanted to further our knowledge on it. For back-end, we went with Django as we felt that it was more flexible and easier to use, once you have some knowledge on it. We also used python in our back-end as it is very flexible and contains a lot of already available tools and libraries which we can use. For version control, we chose GitHub over Bitbucket because it offers a lot of add-ons for increasing development productivity and improving collaboration, plus GitHub has a faster performance, and we are more familiar with it as weâ€™ve been using it.
